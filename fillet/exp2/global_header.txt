# FILLET Exp2 with HEXTOR - using cloudir = -6.3 to stay consistent with Ben2 and Ben3
# Compile all cases into a list

# Name of benchmark/experiment: Experiment 2
# Describe how ice line latitude is determined: ice line occurs if zonal average temperature is less than or equal to 263

# Columns of data
# Case = case number (0 -> total number of cases in experiment)
# Inst = instellation (S_earth; i.e., relative to Earth's 1361 W m^-2)
# Obl = obliquity (degrees)
# XCO2 = mixing ratio (volume) of CO2 (ppm)
# Tglob = global, annual mean surface temperature (K)
# IceLineNMax = latitude of northern edge of ice in northern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineNMin = latitude of southern edge of ice in northern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineSMax = latitude of northern edge of ice in southern hemisphere (deg)
# IceLineSMin = latitude of southern edge of ice in southern hemisphere (deg)
# Diff = diffusion coefficient
# OLR = global, annual mean outgoing longwave radiation

# Examples for IceLine max and min:
# Polar caps: IceLineNMax = 90, IceLineNMin = 60, IceLineSMax = -60, IceLineSMin = -90
# Snowball state: IceLineNMax = 90, IceLineNMin = 0, IceLineSMax = 0, IceLineSMin = -90
# Ice free state: IceLineNMax = 90, IceLineNMin = 90, IceLineSMax = -90, IceLineSMin = -90
# Ice belt: IceLineNMax = 30, IceLineNMin = 0, IceLineSMax = 0, IceLineSMin = -30
# Note ice belt doesn't really have "edges" at 0 deg, but record as 0 anyway to
# keep the columns the same length

# Case Inst Obl XCO2 Tglob IceLineNMax IceLineNMin IceLineSMax IceLineSMin Diff OLRglob
