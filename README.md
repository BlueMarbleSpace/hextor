# HEXTOR (Habitable EBM for eXoplaneT ObseRvations)

README file for release 4.0.0

## Obtaining the Code
Use the command below to clone the repository with submodules. This is required to obtain the ffhash module, which is required for the radiaitive transfer lookup table.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BlueMarbleSpace/hextor.git`

## Running the Model

1. Edit ./model/Makefile and set the values of the Fortran compiler FC and location of this model WDIR

2. Edit runEBM.sh set the value of "wdir"

3. Adjust any model parameters by editing the file ./input.nml. Additional namelists confiturations are provided in ./namelists/

4. Adjust the length of the model integration by setting the value of the "niter" parameter in ./model/driver.f

5. Adjust the star by uncommenting the appropriate line in radiation/radiation.f90

6. Run the script by executing ./runEBM.sh

7. Model output is located in ./model/out/

- The file "tempseries.out" lists columns as: 
    time, max temp, min temp, pg0, pco2, co2condensation, fh2, diffusion

- CO2 condensation is indicated by a 1 (condensing) or 0 (not condensing) in the file above.

- H2 is not implemented in the current version of the lookup table
